A free, easy way to manage your nonprofit’s volunteers.

== Description ==

A simple, free way to keep track of your nonprofit’s volunteers and opportunities.

**How can the Wired Impact Volunteer Management plugin help your nonprofit?**

* **Post one-time and flexible volunteer opportunities on your website –** Promote volunteer opportunities on any page of your website using a simple shortcode.
* **Volunteers can sign up directly on your website –** Make volunteering even easier for your supporters by giving them the option to sign up for an opportunity directly on your website. A confirmation email will be sent to you and the volunteer once they sign up. 
* **Control the number of sign-ups available for opportunities –** Only need 10 people to help out at an event? Set a cap on the number of people who can sign up. Want as many volunteers as you can get? No problem. You don’t have to set a cap.
* **Customizable reminder emails for one-time opportunities –** Make sure your volunteers get all the information they need before showing up to help. You control when they get the email and what information it includes.
* **Volunteer profiles that track participation and more –** Keep track of all of your volunteers’ involvement. See what they’ve helped out with, how long they’ve been helping and add notes that will help you stay organized.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do you get started? =

Once you’ve downloaded the plugin, you’ll want to adjust the setting to fit your specific needs. You can do this by visiting the Volunteer Management menu and clicking “Settings”. Here, you can choose to include our styles, set a default contact and location for volunteer opportunities, and create a template for your confirmation and reminder emails.

= How do you create a new volunteer opportunity? =

1.	In the Volunteer Management menu, click “Opportunities” 
1.	On the Opportunities page, click “Add Volunteer Opportunity”
1.	Fill in all of the information fields
1.	Click the blue “Publish” button
1.	To display the opportunities on your website, you’ll need to include the following shortcodes in the page content (Visual Editor): [one_time_volunteer_opps] (for one-time opportunities), [flexible_volunteer_opps] (for flexible opportunities)

It’s important to note, you can’t post both types of opportunities on the same page. Please list only one of the shortcodes on each page.

= What is the difference between the two types of opportunities? = 

One-time volunteer opportunities happen at a fixed date and time. One example might be a yearly trivia night fundraiser.

Flexible volunteer opportunities can happen on different days and times. One example might be weekly tutoring. Another example could be looking for a volunteer to help with your social media or blog.

= How do I add a volunteer to our database? =

You can’t manually add a volunteer to the database. Volunteers appear in the database after signing up for an opportunity.

= How do I add notes about a volunteer? =

1.	In the Volunteer Management menu, click “Volunteers” 
1.	Click the name of the volunteer you’d like to add a note about 
1.	Click “Edit Volunteer Info”
1.	Scroll to the bottom of the page to the Notes section 
1.	Add or edit any notes
1.	Click “Update User” to save any changes

= How do I remove a volunteer from a specific opportunity? =

If a volunteer is no longer able to help out at a specific opportunity, you can remove them from the sign up list. 

1.	Click “Opportunities” from the Volunteer Management menu
1.	Find the opportunity you need to remove the volunteer from 
1.	Click the opportunity to edit 
1.	Scroll down to the RSVP list, find the volunteer’s name and click “Remove RSVP”
1.	Confirm their removal by clicking the blue “Remove RSVP” button

= How do I create a recurring opportunity? =

If you have a recurring opportunity where different people will sign up each time, we recommend creating a one-time opportunity for each date and time. That will allow you to track the RSVPs separately.

If the recurring opportunity will have the same volunteers each time, we’d recommend you create one flexible volunteer opportunity.
